## Description
Implement a secure email/password authentication system that allows users to register, verify their accounts, log in securely, and reset passwords when needed.

## Background
Currently, our platform lacks a proper authentication system, which limits user-specific functionality and presents security concerns. A robust email/password authentication mechanism is required as the foundation of our user management system before we can implement more advanced features like social login and MFA.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can register with email, password, and basic profile information
2. Users receive an email verification link upon registration
3. Users cannot fully access the system until email is verified
4. Users can log in with their verified email and password
5. Login attempts are rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks
6. Users can request a password reset via email
7. Users can set a new password using a secure reset link
8. Password storage follows security best practices (bcrypt hashing)
9. Sessions are managed securely using JWT tokens
10. Users can log out, which invalidates their current session

## Technical Details
- Authentication service should implement the following REST endpoints:
  ```
  POST /api/auth/register
  POST /api/auth/verify-email
  POST /api/auth/login
  POST /api/auth/logout
  POST /api/auth/forgot-password
  POST /api/auth/reset-password
  ```

- Password requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

- JWT token configuration:
  - Access tokens expire after 15 minutes
  - Refresh tokens expire after 7 days
  - Tokens must include user ID, roles, and permissions

- Email verification token validity: 24 hours
- Password reset token validity: 1 hour
- Rate limiting: 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes triggers a 30-minute lockout

## Dependencies
- Database schema for user accounts must be implemented first
- Email notification service must be configured and operational
- API Gateway must be set up to route authentication requests

## Additional Notes
- Consider implementing account lockout notifications
- Plan for future integration with social login providers
- Document the authentication flow for frontend developers
- Implement proper logging for security audit purposes
