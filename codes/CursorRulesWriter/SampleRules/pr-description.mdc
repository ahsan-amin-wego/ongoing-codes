# PR Description Template

Generates a Pull Request description template based on the section structure (Context, Approach, Testing, Checklist) from the official template at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

> See @cursor-rules-base.mdc for base template and metadata patterns
> See @cursor-rules-creation.mdc for creation standards
> References structure from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

/**
 * @LLMNote: PR Description template generator that:
 * 1. Uses the structure from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (Context, Approach, Testing, Checklist).
 * 2. Provides a ready-to-use template reflecting the repository's standard PR structure.
 * 3. Includes the official checklist from the GitHub template.
 * 4. **Generation Guidance:**
 *    - Base the description primarily on the Jira ticket (ask for it if needed) or the associated dev plan (`.cursor/tasks/PAY-XXX.md`).
 *    - When populating the Approach section based on a dev plan, DO NOT explicitly mention the source document (e.g., "outlined in docs/PAY-XXX.md") and DO NOT use prefixes like "Test:", "Code:", or "Refactor:" for the steps.
 *    - Do not include specific file paths in the Approach steps unless essential for understanding the change.
 *    - Do not include routine final steps (like code reviews, formatting checks, or running all tests) in the Approach section. Focus on direct implementation actions.
 *    - Ensure generated content uses correct Markdown formatting with actual newlines, especially if it will be passed to other tools (like `gh` CLI or MCP tools via temporary files, see @core-engineering-standards.mdc).
