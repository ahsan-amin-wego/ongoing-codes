      # Rule File Organization

      1. File Location:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── playwright.mdc           # Test automation
         ├── formatting.mdc           # Code formatting
         ├── cursor-rules-*.mdc       # Meta-rules
         └── ...
         ```
         - All rules in .cursor/rules/
         - No subdirectories allowed

      2. Naming Convention:
         ```
         cursor-rules-*.mdc    # Meta-rules
         domain-*.mdc          # Domain rules
         feature-*.mdc         # Feature rules
         ```
         - Use kebab-case
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive

      3. Organization:
         - Group related rules
         - Keep files flat
         - Use cross-references
         - Follow version control:
           - Include in code review
           - Update version numbers
           - Maintain compatibility

  version: 1.1
